[pytest]
markers =
    fast: Fast unit tests (<1s each), pure Python with all I/O mocked
    medium: Medium tests with database fixtures, API TestClient, or filesystem ops
    slow: Slow tests with external APIs, pipeline runs, or LLM operations
    integration: Cross-component integration tests (combinable with tiers)
    serial: Tests that must run serially (not parallelizable)
    unit: [DEPRECATED] Use 'fast' instead

# Default test paths
testpaths = tests

# Default: run fast tier only (quick feedback during development)
# Pre-merge: use `pytest -m "not slow"` to include medium tests
# Full suite: use `pytest --override-ini="addopts=" -v` to run all tiers
addopts = --showlocals --tb=short -m "not slow and not medium" --strict-markers
