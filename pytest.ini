[pytest]
markers =
    fast: Pure unit tests — no DB, no network, minimal file I/O (auto-assigned to unmarked tests)
    medium: DB fixtures, filesystem I/O, multi-service mock orchestration, async workflows
    slow: External APIs, pipeline runs, LLM calls, heavy integration
    integration: Cross-component integration tests
    serial: Tests that must not run in parallel (shared state, port binding, etc.)
    unit: Unit tests (alias for fast)

# Default test paths
testpaths = tests

# Pytest options: show locals in tracebacks, shorter format
addopts = --showlocals --tb=short
