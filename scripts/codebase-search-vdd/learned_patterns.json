The main issues are: 1) The _build_search_patterns function creates patterns that may not match actual file structures, 2) The keyword extraction is too restrictive, requiring words >2 characters and filtering too aggressively, 3) The file limit of 100 in _search_for_keywords is too low for large codebases. The search needs to be more inclusive initially.",
