# Ralph Loop Progress - Feed Forward Story Generation

## Initial Context

### Project Overview
- **Project**: Feed Forward (feedback → engineering stories)
- **Setup Date**: 2026-01-13
- **Setup By**: Claude Code (automated setup)
- **Goal**: Generate high-quality engineering stories that achieve:
  - Gestalt Score: >= 4.0/5.0
  - Dimensional Average: >= 3.5/5.0
  - Playwright Validation: >= 85% accuracy

---

## Database Status (at setup)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total stories in system | 2 |
| Stories in candidate/draft status | 2 |
| Average confidence_score | 0.885 |

### Stories Imported to prd.json

1. **story-001**: [4] Investigate AI Copilot Integration Friction
   - Confidence: 0.85 (lowest - priority)
   - Type: Pain Point / Theme
   - Source: Coda research (4 participants)

2. **story-002**: [7] Fix Pinterest OAuth Failure
   - Confidence: 0.92
   - Type: Bug / Integration Issue
   - Source: Intercom (7 reports)

## Available Knowledge Files

- [x] `docs/story_knowledge_base.md` - GOLD STANDARD (your north star)
- [x] `docs/tailwind-codebase-map.md` - Authoritative codebase mapping
- [x] `docs/feedback-analysis-kb.md` - Tactical guidance

---

## Setup Verification Checklist

- [x] ralph.sh is executable (chmod +x completed)
- [x] PROMPT.md is complete (1100+ lines)
- [x] prd.json contains 2 stories
- [x] progress.txt is this file
- [ ] All files committed to git (pending)
- [x] PostgreSQL connection verified
- [x] Claude Code CLI configured with --dangerously-skip-permissions

---

## Ready for First Run

When ready, execute:
```bash
cd scripts/ralph/
./ralph.sh 15
```

This will start Ralph in autonomous mode for up to 15 iterations.

---

## Notes for First Run

1. **Monitor in separate terminal**: `tail -f scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
2. Ralph will append iteration data to this file
3. Each iteration takes 5-10 minutes depending on story count
4. Do NOT interrupt unless errors are detected (see troubleshooting)

### Expected First Iteration Actions

1. Read all required files (progress.txt, prd.json, knowledge bases)
2. Select stories to work on (likely both, given small count)
3. Begin refinement process
4. Apply INVEST criteria evaluation
5. Identify technical context from codebase map
6. Update stories in prd.json
7. Begin validation cycle

## Iteration History

*Iterations will be logged below as Ralph runs*

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Loop terminates early
- Check ralph.sh output in `/tmp/ralph_output_*.txt`
- Look for completion or plateau promise
- Review last iteration notes below

### Issue: Playwright validation fails
- Verify Tailwind URLs in codebase map are current
- Check if authentication is required for URLs
- May need to update URL patterns

### Issue: Database connection fails
- Ralph will fall back to prd.json
- Database not required for operation
- Stories can be manually synced later

### Issue: PROMPT.md not found
- Verify all files exist in scripts/ralph/
- Re-run setup if files are missing

---

## Manual Intervention Points

If Ralph gets stuck, these are safe intervention points:

1. **Between iterations**: Edit prd.json or progress.txt
2. **During validation**: Stop loop, fix URLs in codebase map
3. **Before completion**: Review stories in prd.json before marking complete
