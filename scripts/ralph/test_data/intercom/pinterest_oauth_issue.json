  "source_body": "Hi, I've been trying to reconnect my Pinterest account for the past 3 days and keep getting an error. When I click 'Connect Pinterest' it takes me to Pinterest to authorize, I click allow, but then I get redirected back to Tailwind and it says 'Authorization failed. Please try again.' I've tried:\n\n1. Clearing my browser cache\n2. Using a different browser (Chrome and Safari)\n3. Disconnecting and reconnecting from Pinterest side\n4. Logging out of Tailwind completely\n\nNothing works! This is really frustrating because I have a big campaign planned for next week and I can't schedule any pins right now. The error started happening after Pinterest asked me to re-verify my account.\n\nMy Pinterest username is @myfashionblog and my Tailwind email is sarah@example.com.\n\nPlease help ASAP!",
