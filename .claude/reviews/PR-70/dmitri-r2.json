      "status": "FIXED",
      "verification": "selectedRunId removed from deps array. Uses hasUserSelectedRunRef (ref) to track manual selection without triggering re-renders. This is idiomatic React, not a workaround.",

  "positive_observations": [
    "D1 fix uses React best practices (refs for non-rendering state)",
    "hasUserSelectedRunRef pattern is clean and minimal",
    "Comments clearly explain the auto-selection logic",
    "NEW_STORIES_DISPLAY_LIMIT constant improves maintainability",
    "validate_iso_timestamp() is simple and focused (no over-engineering)",
    "All tests pass (95 tests)",
    "No new YAGNI violations"

  "summary": "D1 circular dependency cleanly resolved with idiomatic React ref pattern. No unnecessary complexity introduced. Backend validation is minimal and focused. All tests pass. Ready to merge.",
