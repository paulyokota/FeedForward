      "title": "React Component Has Mild Complexity in Dependencies",
      "location": "webapp/src/app/pipeline/page.tsx:122",
      "description": "The fetchData callback includes selectedRunId in its dependency array, creating a circular relationship that adds mental overhead. The conditional check prevents infinite loops but is fragile.",
      "suggestion": "Split into two separate effects or add a comment explaining why the dependency is safe.",

      "title": "Test Coverage Might Be Overdoing It",
      "location": "webapp/src/app/pipeline/__tests__/PipelinePage.test.tsx",
      "description": "9 tests for relatively simple UI behavior. Some tests check implementation details (CSS classes, truncation logic) rather than user behavior, which makes them brittle.",
      "suggestion": "Monitor for test brittleness. If tests start failing frequently due to UI refactors, consolidate them.",

  ],
  "positive_observations": [
    "Backend filter is perfectly minimal (simple SQL WHERE clause)",
    "No premature optimization (no pagination, caching, or infinite scroll)",
    "No dead code - every line added is used",
    "Tests match the feature scope",
    "Frontend reuses existing components instead of duplicating"
  ],
  "summary": "Well-scoped PR with minimal backend changes and focused frontend implementation. Minor code smell in React dependency management, but nothing blocking. Recommend approval after addressing D1.",
