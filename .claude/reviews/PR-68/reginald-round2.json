  "analysis": {
    "r1_fix_quality": "Good implementation. Batching allows stop checks without cancelling individual API calls. Batch size of 50 is reasonable - large enough for efficiency, small enough for responsiveness.",
    "r2_fix_quality": "Clean implementation. Terminal states properly defined as constant. Cleanup happens on new run start, which prevents leak while allowing status queries on recently-completed runs.",
    "potential_concerns": "Minor: R3-R5 from Round 1 remain unfixed (conversations_filtered always 0, polling interval recreation, status cleared immediately). These are lower priority and acceptable for merge."
