    "Stop check comments are clear and consistent across both Intercom and Coda pipelines",
    "Print messages correctly identify the stage being interrupted (fetch, normalization, classification)",
    "_TERMINAL_STATES constant serves dual purpose: enables cleanup and documents terminal states",
    "Schema already had Literal type documenting valid states - this was a strength in Round 1"
  ],
  "summary": "M1 addressed with appropriate inline documentation. State machine is now understandable. Stop check comments are clear and follow consistent pattern. No new maintainability concerns introduced. Code remains maintainable for MVP scope."
