      "resolution": "simplified",
      "verdict": "acceptable",
      "notes": "Cache simplified to single Dict[str, Dict] keyed by resolved path. While I still maintain full removal would be cleaner, the current implementation is reasonable: (1) single cache variable, (2) clear comments explaining thread-safety rationale, (3) idempotent reads. The pragmatist in me says: it works, it's documented, move on."

      "resolution": "documented",
      "verdict": "acceptable",
      "notes": "Documentation added at lines 1100-1111 explaining each internal codename. This is better than externalizing to YAML for now - the mapping is domain knowledge that needs to live somewhere, and inline comments make it discoverable. External config would add another file to maintain."

      "verdict": "acceptable",
      "notes": "Not addressed, but original severity was LOW. Timing metrics in SyncResult (fetch_duration_ms, pull_duration_ms) remain separate. If a dashboard needs this later, it's available. If not, no harm done."

    "notes": "DMITRI-001 and DMITRI-002 were addressed with reasonable simplifications rather than full rewrites. DMITRI-003 (LOW) deferred - acceptable. DMITRI-004 fixed completely. No new complexity introduced. The code is cleaner than Round 1."
  },
  "verdict": "LGTM. The pragmatist approach was followed: fix what matters, document what remains, don't gold-plate. The cache stays but is simpler. The keywords stay but are documented. The unnecessary second path is gone. Ship it."
