      "why": "Comment claims 'clustering already ensures coherence' but this assumption isn't validated. Signature-based groups with same signature still go through PM review. Hybrid clusters skip it entirely. If assumption wrong, incoherent stories bypass quality gate.",
      "fix": "Option 1: Keep PM review for hybrid clusters until assumption validated. Option 2: Add monitoring/logging. Option 3: Functional test validates assumption holds. Recommend functional testing to verify hybrid cluster coherence matches PM review standards.",
