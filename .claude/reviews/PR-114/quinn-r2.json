Users understand what happened (clear title + count), why it happened (explanation about low confidence/unknown vocabulary), and what to do next (3 specific suggestions: run with more conversations, check vocabulary coverage, review warnings). Styling is polished with amber background, proper icon, and well-organized action section. No UX regressions detected in the UI state machine."

  "summary": "Round 2 verification PASSED. The Q1 issue raised in Round 1 has been properly addressed. The 'All Themes Filtered' panel at lines 1172-1203 now provides complete user guidance through: (1) Clear status communication (title + count), (2) Explanation of why filtering occurred, (3) Three actionable next steps. CSS styling (lines 1982-2044) is consistent with the design system and uses appropriate amber color scheme for quality warnings. No UX regressions detected in the conditional rendering logic or other pipeline page features. All six major UI states render correctly. Accessibility is solid with semantic HTML, good contrast, and icon-based visual indicators. Content tone is helpful and action-oriented. Ready to APPROVE.",
