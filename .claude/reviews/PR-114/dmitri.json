      "why": "Storing detailed quality breakdown in JSONB (vocabulary_match, confidence_score, etc) but no code reads it. YAGNI violation - adding complexity for potential future use. Storage + write overhead + schema complexity with zero current benefit.",
      "fix": "Remove quality_details column for now. Keep quality_score (0.0-1.0) which is sufficient. Add breakdown column in future migration if concrete use case emerges (analytics dashboard, re-scoring, etc).",

      "why": "Migration adds idx_themes_quality_score but no queries filter by quality_score. Index with no queries = wasted storage + maintenance overhead. Premature optimization.",
