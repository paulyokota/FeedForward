      "Variable naming throughout is now clear and descriptive (type_counts, confidence_counts, seen_types, etc.)",
      "Function docstrings are complete and informative",
      "Type annotations are correct and comprehensive",
      "Comments appropriately explain complex logic (e.g., lines 104-107 on falsy string handling)",
      "Consistent patterns for dict access using .get() with defaults",
      "Good use of structured data types (Counter, set for O(1) lookups)",
      "Clear separation of concerns in function structure"
    ],
    "minor_observations": [
      "Loop variable 'r' in _store_dry_run_preview (line 103, 136, 155) is brief but acceptable given context (represents classification result dict)",
      "M2 and M3 from Round 1 not addressed, but these were marked as 'nice to have' / post-merge enhancements"

  },
  "summary": "Round 2 verification complete. M1 variable naming fix has been applied consistently and correctly throughout the codebase. Additional Round 1 fixes (R1 type annotations, S1 security sanitization) also verified. No new maintainability issues detected. Code quality is solid with clear variable names, complete documentation, and proper error handling patterns. Ready for merge."
