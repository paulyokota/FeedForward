      "title": "Silent error handling makes debugging hard",
      "why": "Cleanup function catches all exceptions and returns 0, making it impossible to distinguish between 'no stale runs' and 'database failed'. If DB is down, server starts successfully but stale runs never clean up.",
      "fix": "Either return error state {'cleaned': n, 'error': msg} or let exception propagate to fail fast. Swallowing errors makes 2am debugging impossible.",
