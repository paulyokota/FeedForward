      "why": "Added comment explains math (14s total) but not WHY these values. 'Reasonable' is subjective. Future maintainers won't know if values are tunable, based on docs, or empirically derived.",
      "fix": "Add comment block explaining: (1) no published Intercom guidance, using industry standard; (2) 3 retries = standard for idempotent ops; (3) combined worst-case with timeout = 54s; (4) acceptable for batch, may need tuning for user-facing.",

      "fix": "Enhance docstring to explain: (1) algorithm flow; (2) loop semantics (attempt 0 = first try); (3) final attempt behavior; (4) total attempts = 1 + MAX_RETRIES. See Round 1 M2 for detailed suggestion.",
