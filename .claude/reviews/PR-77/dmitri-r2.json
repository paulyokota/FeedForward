    "D1": {
      "status": "invalid",
      "explanation": "Upon closer inspection, original_signature IS used. It's passed to _generate_description() on line 409, which accepts it as the 4th parameter (line 816). The original analysis was incorrect - the parameter serves a purpose for tracking split provenance."
    },
    "D2": {
      "status": "accepted",
      "explanation": "The duplication between _process_single_result_with_pipeline_run and _process_single_result/_handle_keep_together exists but serves different entry points (file-based vs in-memory pipeline). While refactoring could reduce code, the two paths have distinct initialization patterns. Marking as accepted - not a clear YAGNI violation."
    },
    "D3": {
      "status": "fixed",
      "explanation": "Lines 349-356 now consolidate split and keep_together into a single branch: `if pm_result.decision in (\"keep_together\", \"split\"):` with a debug log explaining the temporary fallthrough behavior. Clean fix."
    },
    "D4": {
      "status": "accepted",
      "explanation": "conversation_ids on line 540 is used only in the log message on line 586. While technically inefficient, it improves log readability. The overhead of a list comprehension on typically small conversation lists is negligible. Not worth the code churn to fix."
    }

  "new_issues": [],
  "summary": "D3 is properly fixed - the split/keep_together branches are now consolidated with explanatory logging. D1 was a false positive - original_signature IS used in the _generate_description call. D2 and D4 are accepted as-is: D2's duplication serves distinct entry points, and D4's minor inefficiency has negligible impact. No new YAGNI violations introduced. Code is ready to merge from a simplicity perspective.",
  "recommendation": "APPROVE"
