      "status": "resolved",
      "verification": "The `from datetime import datetime, timezone` import is now correctly placed at line 10, within the standard import block (lines 7-12). This follows Python import ordering convention."
    },
    "M2": {
      "status": "accepted",
      "verification": "Method name `_process_single_result_with_pipeline_run` remains unchanged. The existing docstring (lines 336-344) adequately explains the differences from `_process_single_result`. While renaming could improve discoverability, the current documentation is sufficient for maintainability."
    },
    "M3": {
      "status": "accepted",
      "verification": "The three-state return pattern in `_explore_codebase_with_classification` (lines 981-1066) retains the same structure. The docstring at lines 996-1006 clearly documents all three return states with explicit caller guidance. This is acceptable for internal helper methods."
    },
    "M4": {
      "status": "resolved",
      "verification": "The `_run_pm_review_and_story_creation` function in pipeline.py (lines 214-224) now has an improved docstring that explains its purpose within the pipeline flow, including mention of PM review split/keep logic and evidence bundle creation."
    },
    "M5": {
      "status": "accepted",
      "verification": "Test file organization remains unchanged. The file already has clear section delimiters (lines 40-43, 214-216, 600-602, 893-895, 1218-1220) with descriptive headers like '# Dual-Format Story Tests' and '# Classification-Guided Exploration Tests'. This provides adequate navigation for a test file of this size."

  "new_issues": [],
  "summary": "All Round 1 issues have been addressed. M1 (import placement) was properly fixed by moving the datetime import to the top of the file. M2, M3, and M5 were accepted as-is after re-evaluation - the existing documentation and organization are sufficient for maintainability. M4 (docstring clarity) was resolved with improved documentation. No new maintainability issues were found in this round. The code is now ready for merge from a clarity and maintainability perspective."
