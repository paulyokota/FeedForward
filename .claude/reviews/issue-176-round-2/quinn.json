      "finding": "OrphanIntegrationService.__init__ (lines 87-92) always creates EvidenceService(db_connection) and passes it to OrphanMatcher (line 100). The 'no_evidence_service' path in OrphanMatcher can only be hit if OrphanMatcher is instantiated directly outside OrphanIntegrationService, which is not the normal pipeline flow.",

      "status": "ACKNOWLEDGED",
