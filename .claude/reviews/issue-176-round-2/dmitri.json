  "verdict": "APPROVE - CONVERGED",
  "summary": "Documentation changes are proportionate. 4 targeted comments added, none verbose. No new bloat. Original D1 (acceptable parallel implementations) remains valid - no action needed.",
  "issues": [],
  "notes": {
    "m1_race_comment": "6-line comment in orphan_matcher.py:308-313 explaining race condition handling. Proportionate - explains non-obvious concurrent behavior.",
    "m2_docstring": "4-line docstring expansion in orphan_service.py:168-171 with DO NOT warning. Prevents future regression. Appropriate length.",
    "m3_cross_reference": "4-line Note in story_creation_service.py:2184-2187 with file:line reference. YAGNI says don't abstract prematurely, but cross-referencing parallel implementations is good maintenance practice.",
    "m4_stories_appended": "4-line comment in orphan_integration.py:37-41 explaining counter semantics. Clarifies non-obvious metric distinction.",
    "bloat_check": "No new abstractions, no new config options, no new parameters. Just targeted comments where code intent wasn't obvious.",
    "d1_status": "Original LOW finding (parallel implementations) unchanged. YAGNI validated: 2 implementations, different data types, no third use case. Don't extract a helper yet."
