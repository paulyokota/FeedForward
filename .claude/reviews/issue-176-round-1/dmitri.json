  "timestamp": "2026-01-30T00:00:00Z",
  "verdict": "APPROVE",
  "summary": "Fix is appropriately designed. create_or_get() pattern is standard PostgreSQL idiom, race condition handling is necessary for concurrent pipelines. Only 1 LOW finding (acceptable code similarity, not bloat).",
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "D1",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "confidence": "medium",
      "category": "indirection",
      "file": "src/orphan_matcher.py",
      "lines": [230, 269],
      "title": "Similar evidence routing code in two places",
      "why": "Both OrphanMatcher._add_to_graduated_story and StoryCreationService._create_or_update_orphan have similar evidence_service.add_conversation() calls. However, they handle different data types (ExtractedTheme vs ConversationData) and serve different pipelines.",
      "fix": "No action required. The ~15 lines of similarity is acceptable. YAGNI - wait for a third use case before extracting a shared helper.",
      "verify": null,
      "scope": "isolated",

  ],
  "notes": {
    "create_or_get": "Standard PostgreSQL ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING + re-read pattern. Not over-engineered.",
    "race_handling": "Necessary for concurrent pipeline workers. Not premature optimization.",
    "evidence_service_param": "Actively used by OrphanIntegrationService. Valid dependency injection.",
    "stories_appended": "1-line counter addition for observability. Minimal instrumentation."
