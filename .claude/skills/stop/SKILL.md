# /stop

You just acted without permission.

## What happened

The user asked you to UNDERSTAND something (investigate, evaluate, analyze, explain, look into). You started DOING something (writing, editing, creating, building, implementing).

## What to do now

1. **Acknowledge it.** Don't minimize. Don't explain. Just: "You're right. I started doing X when you asked me to Y."

2. **Undo if needed.** If you wrote a file, offer to revert it. If you started a process, stop it.

3. **Wait.** Ask what they actually want. Then WAIT for the answer before doing anything.

## That's it

No framework. No four questions. Just stop, acknowledge, wait.
