# The Box

Tooling for Claude-in-a-Box product discovery. Starts empty, grows from use.

See `reference/claude-in-a-box.md` for why this exists.

## What goes here

Things that make investigations better — but only after they've proven useful.
Nothing speculative. If you're thinking "we might need this," stop. Do the
investigation first. Build the tool after.
