# Tailwind Product Documentation

### **Feature Documentation: SmartSchedule**

*Automatically post at the best times for engagement, without guesswork.*

**Category:** Scheduling  
**Also Known As:** Best Times to Post, Optimal Scheduling, Auto-Scheduler, Pinterest SmartSchedule

**Problem It Solves**

* Users worry they don’t know when their audience is most active on Pinterest.  
* Manually picking posting times feels like guesswork and creates anxiety about poor performance.  
* Concern that posting at the wrong times will waste effort and miss potential reach.  
* Inconsistent timing makes it hard to feel confident about building predictable engagement and traffic.  
* Having to decide *every single time* when to schedule each Pin is repetitive and overwhelming.  
* Managing how many times per day or per week to post without a clear framework creates inconsistency and stress.  
* Fear of overposting or underposting without clear guidance on frequency.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Function*

* SmartSchedule generates a publishing calendar with optimized time slots to help maximize reach and consistency.  
* Automatically suggests the number of daily time slots to maintain an effective cadence.  
* Eliminates the need to manually choose posting times for every Pin by providing a ready-to-use schedule.  
* SmartSchedule uses platform-wide engagement patterns and scheduling best practices rather than account-specific historical performance.

*Advanced Controls*

* Users can regenerate a SmartSchedule to start fresh, or manually add/remove slots.  
* Time slots adapt dynamically as scheduled content is added, ensuring balanced distribution across days and times.  
* Any scheduled Pin can be manually **locked** to its slot. Interval Pins can also be set to **auto-lock**, meaning they won’t move if the schedule is shuffled.  
* Lock and auto-lock options appear directly when scheduling or editing Pins, so users can easily protect specific posts.  
* Works in tandem with Pin Spacing to balance both *when* and *how often* content goes out.

**How to Access**

* SmartSchedule is built directly into **Pin Scheduler**.  
* Access SmartSchedule settings from the top-right of the Pin Scheduler calendar.  
* Options include regenerating a new SmartSchedule, adding/removing slots, locking Pins, and toggling Pin Spacing visibility.

**Key Benefits**

* Always post at recommended, Pinterest-optimized times.  
* Stop making repetitive decisions—SmartSchedule chooses *when* to post so you don’t have to.  
* Stay consistent in daily and weekly posting frequency with no extra effort.  
* Avoid overposting or underposting with balanced scheduling guidance.  
* Save time by automatically placing scheduled content into the right slots.  
* Reduce stress with a fully managed posting calendar.  
* Lock important Pins when exact timing matters.  
* Use alongside Pin Spacing for safe, Pinterest-friendly distribution.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Set It and Forget It**: Build a calendar once and trust SmartSchedule to handle timing.  
* **Maximum Reach, Minimal Effort**: Every Pin gets its best chance to be seen.  
* **Confidence Without Guesswork**: Post at times backed by Tailwind’s data, not hunches.  
* **Consistent Cadence**: Keep your brand visible daily and weekly without manual oversight.  
* **Decision-Free Scheduling**: No more stressing about when or how often to post—SmartSchedule does it.  
* **Avoid Overposting or Underposting**: Follow SmartSchedule’s balanced structure to stay effective.  
* **Control When Needed**: Lock specific Pins so they publish at the exact time you choose.

**Proof Points**

* \[Placeholder: Tailwind internal stat showing % engagement lift when publishing via SmartSchedule vs manual times—e.g., average increase in impressions, repins, or traffic growth\]  
* \[Placeholder: Customer testimonial about improved reach, time saved, or peace of mind with SmartSchedule\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* SmartSchedule is based on Tailwind’s scheduling dataset and recommendations, which may not perfectly match every niche audience.  
* Users still need enough content to fill the suggested slots.  
* Locking too many Pins may reduce scheduling flexibility.  
* Previously, SmartSchedule incorporated historical engagement data. This is no longer the case, though older materials may reference it.

**Related Features**

* **Pin Scheduler** – core interface where SmartSchedule operates.  
* **Pin Spacing** – ensures a safe interval between Pins from the same URL within SmartSchedule slots.  
* **Shuffle Schedule** – lets users randomize scheduled content while still honoring SmartSchedule and respecting locked Pins.  
* **Interval Pins (Legacy)** – manual alternative for setting intervals, though largely superseded by SmartSchedule + Pin Spacing.

### **Feature Documentation: SmartPin**

**Feature Name**  
SmartPin – Automatically generate fresh, optimized Pins from any URL.

**Category:** AI Creation  
**Also Known As:** Automated Pin Generator, AI Pin Creator

**Problem It Solves**  
Creating fresh Pins ("fresh Pins" is the key phrase Pinterest marketers use for unique, newly created Pins that don’t repeat the copy or pin image of other Pins with that URL) can be extremely time consuming. Pinterest rewards publishing multiple unique, fresh Pins for the same piece of content over time, but manually designing new images and writing unique copy (titles and descriptions) quickly becomes a bottleneck.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

SmartPin automatically generates new, ready‑to‑publish Pins from any URL a user enables. Each week, a fresh SmartPin is created with:

* An automatically applied text overlay/design placed over a real photo pulled from the user’s site.  
* AI‑written copy for the text overlay, Pin title, and description—all unique each time.  
* Built‑in logic to select the best photo from the page.

*Advanced Controls*

When setting up a SmartPin, users can:

* Review the images SmartPin found on their webpage and select which ones SmartPin should use or draw from.  
* Specify keywords they want SmartPin to include in the generated titles and descriptions.  
  * Tip: Users can source these keywords from **Keyword Research** to choose higher-strength Pinterest SEO terms before generating SmartPins.  
* Get an initial SmartPin right away, with automatic generation every seven days thereafter (unless toggled off on the SmartPin page).

After a SmartPin is generated, users can refine it directly in Pin Scheduler. A **Change Design** CTA on the draft allows:

* Choosing from three different text overlay design templates or an option that uses the original image with no overlay (useful for diagrams, images with copy, or product visuals).  
* Adjusting design colors and fonts, then locking those choices so the draft updates with the new style.

The dedicated **SmartPin page** shows all URLs a user has enabled for SmartPins. Here, they can:

* See toggles for whether weekly SmartPins are active per URL.  
* Update image selections and keywords for each URL, which informs future SmartPins.

SmartPins use AI credits—each SmartPin costs three credits, drawn from the user’s subscription plan (credits renew monthly based on plan tier; monthly AI credits are included in each plan).

SmartPins flow seamlessly into Pin Scheduler and SmartSchedule, so once generated they can be scheduled, spaced, and published at optimal times.

Users can edit and tweak as desired, then publish—saving hours of repetitive creative work.

**How to Access**  
SmartPin is available from a CTA on the main dashboard page and from a CTA in the sub‑nav at the top of the Pin Scheduler page.

**Key Benefits**

* Save significant time creating fresh Pins by letting AI handle design + copy.  
* Ensure a steady stream of unique, fresh Pins that align with Pinterest best practices.  
* Maintain visual and brand consistency with automatically applied overlays on site imagery.  
* Customize designs easily with template, color, and font options so Pins match brand style.  
* Control inputs by choosing preferred images and keywords for higher relevance.  
* SmartPin page centralizes management of all active URLs and settings.  
* Provide continuous creation of fresh Pins to improve visibility and Pinterest traction.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Always Fresh Pins, Always On**: Keep your Pinterest feed active with new fresh Pins every week without lifting a finger.  
* **Batch Less, Publish More**: Replace hours of design and copywriting with AI‑generated Pins.  
* **Maximize Content Value**: Get more reach from every blog post or product page by continually publishing new versions.  
* **Educational & Text-Heavy Content**: Ideal for products like workbooks or infographics where an overlay may not fit; use the original image option for clarity.  
* **SEO & Rich Content Blogs**: Perfect for long‑form content publishers who want to generate ongoing Pinterest traffic without constantly redesigning Pins.

**Proof Points**

* \[Placeholder: Tailwind internal data on engagement lift with SmartPins – e.g., average # of SmartPins generated per URL, % increase in engagement vs manual\]  
* \[Placeholder: Customer quote on time saved or increased reach\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* Quality depends on the imagery available on the user’s website; poor photos may limit results.  
* Users should review and tweak copy/design for brand voice and accuracy.  
* SmartPins generate weekly per URL—frequency is fixed at once per week.  
* Each SmartPin consumes three AI credits from the user’s plan; heavy use may exhaust credits quickly.  
* Usage may be limited by the user’s plan tier. Tailwind features that rely on AI or automation draw from monthly credits included in each plan (Free, Pro, Advanced, Max). Credits reset monthly and determine how much of the feature a user can access.  
* SmartPin requires a valid URL with usable images for generation.  
* Text overlay templates may not suit every type of image (e.g., diagrams or images with heavy copy).

**Related Features**

* **Ghostwriter** – powers SmartPin text generation (titles and descriptions).  
* **Pin Scheduler** – where SmartPins can be queued, spaced, and published.  
* **SmartSchedule** – ensures SmartPins go out at the best times.  
* **Keyword Research** – discover higher-strength keywords to feed into SmartPin keyword settings.  
* *See also*: Ghostwriter, Pin Scheduler, SmartSchedule for deeper integration details.

### **Feature Documentation: Pin Spacing**

*Protect account health and boost reach by automatically spacing out similar Pins.*

**Category:** Scheduling  
**Also Known As:** Interval Control, Duplicate Protection

**Problem It Solves**

* Posting too many Pins from the same URL in a short window can trigger Pinterest spam filters or hurt performance.  
* Manually calculating and spacing Pins across the calendar is tedious and error-prone.  
* Inconsistent spacing can undermine engagement and lead to wasted effort.  
* Risk of Pinterest algorithm penalties or even account suspension if posting patterns appear spammy.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
 *Core Function*

* Automatically enforces a minimum spacing interval between Pins from the same URL, ensuring steady distribution and healthier performance.

*Advanced Controls*

* **Default Pin Spacing Rule** – applies to all URLs. Any two Pins with the same URL will be separated by at least the default interval. Tailwind’s default is **seven days**, and the UI recommends spacing of at least seven days between Pins to the same URL.  
* **Custom Pin Spacing Rules** – can be set for specific URLs with different spacing than the default. Users can combine both types: just default, just custom, or a mix of both.  
* Pin Spacing is the modern, set‑and‑forget successor to the older Interval Pins tool. Interval Pins had to be configured each time a user scheduled a batch (choosing exact intervals and manually locking them in), while Pin Spacing runs automatically once rules are set—removing repetitive setup and saving significant effort.

**How to Access**

* **First-time setup**: After a new user connects a Pinterest account and schedules their first Pin in **Pin Scheduler**, they are prompted to create a Pin Spacing rule.  
* **Ongoing setup**: Inside **Pin Scheduler**, users can access the Pin Spacing settings from the icon at the top right of the SmartSchedule section. Here they can:  
  * Create, edit, or delete the default rule.  
  * Search for specific URLs by page title or URL using a search field. Any URL with active or scheduled Pins can be found this way.  
  * Create, edit, or delete a custom rule for a specific URL.

**Key Benefits**

* Protect Pinterest account health by avoiding spammy posting patterns.  
* Ensure consistent engagement by keeping content evenly spaced.  
* Eliminate manual work of tracking posting intervals.  
* Gain confidence that scheduled campaigns won’t overwhelm followers or algorithms.  
* Aligns with Pinterest best practices, reassuring users they are scheduling in a way that supports compliance and visibility.  
* Supports Pinterest SEO by ensuring content surfaces consistently over time.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Peace of Mind Posting**: Upload dozens of Pins at once, confident they’ll roll out smoothly and safely.  
* **Seasonal Campaigns, Done Right**: Spread out multiple versions of holiday Pins to maximize impressions across the season.  
* **Evergreen Traffic Stream**: Keep content flowing to your top URLs week after week without clustering.  
* **Stay Safe, Stay Seen**: Avoid spam flags while maintaining visibility with Pinterest-friendly posting patterns.  
* **Pinterest SEO Optimization**: Maintain long-term visibility by spacing Pins in a way that supports Pinterest’s SEO signals.

**Proof Points**

* \[Placeholder: Insert Tailwind data/stat on engagement lift or reduction in spam flags when Pin Spacing is used\]  
* \[Placeholder: Insert customer quote/testimonial about peace of mind or time saved with Pin Spacing\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* Guarantees a **minimum** interval (e.g., 2 days or 7 days) but does not promise exact spacing for every Pin—other scheduling factors (SmartSchedule, queue balance) can adjust exact placement.  
* Relies on Tailwind’s scheduling logic; users cannot set custom rules beyond the defaults and custom URL rules provided.  
* Works best for users with a steady stream of Pins; very sparse calendars may reduce its effect.  
* Operates within Pinterest API constraints, so certain behaviors are governed by Pinterest’s publishing system.

**Related Features**

* **Pin Scheduler** – core feature where Pin Spacing operates.  
* **SmartSchedule** – optimizes times of day for maximum engagement in combination with spacing.  
* **Interval Pins (Legacy)** – older manual tool for spacing. Interval Pins required users to set exact intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) and lock them in manually. Pin Spacing improves on this by automating the process, requiring less setup, and adapting dynamically to the queue while still honoring minimum spacing rules.  
* **Shuffle Queue** – can further randomize the order of Pins while respecting spacing rules.

### **Feature Documentation: Pin Scheduler**

*Save time and stay consistent by batching and auto-queuing Pins.*

**Category:** Scheduling  
**Also Known As:** Pin Scheduling, Post Scheduler, Queue

**Problem It Solves**

* Managing many Pins individually is tedious; users want to work in batches.  
* It’s difficult to maintain a consistent publishing cadence without being glued to Pinterest daily.  
* Posting too many similar Pins in a short window can hurt performance or trigger Pinterest spam concerns.  
* Users lack clear guidance on *when* to post for best results.  
* Gaps or empty time slots can undermine reach and consistency.  
* Creating fresh Pin content (titles, descriptions, images) is a time-consuming bottleneck.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

* Draft, bulk process, and schedule multiple Pins at once.  
* Queue Pins to maintain consistency while working in batches.  
* Tools to space out content (Pin Spacing) and avoid frequency/duplication issues.  
* SmartSchedule to automatically select optimal posting times.  
* Shuffle/move-up features to fill empty slots and balance the queue.  
* Integrated AI tools (Ghostwriter for titles/descriptions, SmartPin for full Pin creation).  
* **Bulk draft creation via CSV Import** for spreadsheet-driven workflows.

*Advanced Controls*

* Set a default for new drafts as either a Standard Pin or Simplified Pin.  
* Toggle the Simplified Pin field on or off for individual drafts.  
* Toggle visibility of the Alt Text field in Pin forms.  
* Control whether Interval Pins remain locked in the schedule once placed.  
* Integrates with the Tailwind Browser Extension to capture content from the web and finish scheduling inside Pin Scheduler.  
* Unlock all Pins or lock all Pins at once for bulk management.  
* Access SmartSchedule settings directly: add/remove time slots or regenerate an entirely new Smart Schedule.  
* Use **Interval Pins (Legacy)** to schedule multiple instances of the same Pin across different boards, with user-defined intervals (daily, weekly, monthly). While still available, this is a predecessor to Pin Spacing and requires more manual setup.  
* Create and apply **Board Lists** to easily add groups of boards to a draft all at once, simplifying multi-board scheduling.

**How to Access**

* For users with a Pinterest account authorized, Pin Scheduler is the default landing page when logging in (unless they change their default to Dashboard).  
* It can also be accessed at any time from the **top of the left-hand sidebar navigation**.

**Key Benefits**

* Save time by batching work and scheduling Pins in advance.  
* Maintain a consistent publishing cadence without daily manual effort.  
* Protect account health by spacing out similar Pins to avoid spam concerns.  
* Boost performance with SmartSchedule’s data-driven posting times.  
* Create fresh Pin content quickly with integrated AI tools (Ghostwriter, SmartPin).

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Batching for Busy People**  
  “Perfect for small business owners who only have a couple hours a week to focus on marketing—schedule once, stay consistent all week.”  
* **Seasonal & Evergreen Campaigns**  
  “Load up months’ worth of holiday or seasonal content in advance so you never miss the moment.”  
* **Protecting Pinterest Account Health**  
  “Avoid spammy posting patterns with automatic spacing between similar Pins.”  
* **Always-On Marketing**  
  “Even when you’re offline, your Pins go out at the best times for engagement.”  
* **AI-Enhanced Creation**  
  “No need to stare at a blank screen—generate titles, descriptions, or even full Pins with integrated AI.”

**Proof Points**

* \[Placeholder: Insert Tailwind data/stat on engagement lift for scheduled vs. manual posting\]  
* \[Placeholder: Insert customer quote/testimonial about time saved using Pin Scheduler\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* Users must authorize connecting their Pinterest account to Tailwind (granting permission to publish on their behalf and access analytics data).  
* Scheduling too many Pins to the same URL in a short time can trigger Pinterest spam filters.  
* SmartSchedule posting times are optimized by Tailwind’s algorithm but may not align perfectly with every niche audience.  
* Pin Spacing guarantees only a *minimum* number of days between posts from the same URL, not exact spacing, due to balancing multiple URLs within the calendar.  
* Pin Scheduler requires a Pin title, Pin description, destination URL, and board selection for a Pin to be scheduled/published. Some of these fields are optional when scheduling directly through Pinterest, but are required via the API.  
* Interval Pins are still available but largely superseded by Pin Spacing; they require manual setup and ongoing management, whereas Pin Spacing provides a simpler automated approach.  
* Usage may be limited by the user’s plan tier. Tailwind features that rely on AI or automation draw from monthly credits included in each plan (Free, Pro, Advanced, Max). Credits reset monthly and determine how much of the feature a user can access.

**Related Features**

* **SmartSchedule** – tightly integrated; automatically selects optimal posting times within Pin Scheduler.  
* **Pin Spacing** – tightly integrated; ensures a minimum number of days between Pins from the same URL.  
* **Shuffle Queue / Move Up Pins** – integrated queue management tools to rearrange or fill empty slots.  
* **Ghostwriter** – integrated AI tool for generating Pin titles and descriptions.  
* **SmartPin** – integrated AI tool that generates complete Pins (image, title, description).  
* **CSV Import** – create Pin Scheduler drafts in bulk from a spreadsheet-first workflow.  
* **Multi-Network Scheduler** – adjacent feature; schedule content to Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram from the same interface, separate from Pin Scheduler.

### **Feature Documentation: CSV Import**

*Create Pin drafts at scale by importing structured data directly into Pin Scheduler.*

**Category:** Scheduling  
**Also Known As:** CSV Upload, Bulk Pin Import

**Problem It Solves**

* Power users often manage Pinterest marketing through established systems built in spreadsheets or other tools—and they’re not willing to break those workflows.  
* Many users learned these systems from Pinterest course creators or thought leaders, and their process depends on CSV-based planning.  
* Manual or media-first upload flows are too slow for large batches of Pins.  
* Creating dozens or hundreds of Pins one-by-one increases friction, repetition, and mistakes.  
* Users need a deterministic, repeatable way to turn structured planning data into Tailwind drafts.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

* Import Pins in bulk using a CSV file directly inside **Pin Scheduler**.  
* Upload a CSV by drag-and-drop or by browsing for a file.  
* Use a default Pinterest account for draft creation, with the option to change it before importing.  
* Tailwind automatically attempts to map your CSV’s column headers to Tailwind’s supported Pin fields.  
* After upload, users are shown the exact mapping so they can verify what will be used for draft creation.  
* Create drafts from CSV rows with a single action. Drafts appear in Pin Scheduler immediately.

*Supported Fields (All Optional)*

* Pin title (max **100** characters)  
* Pin description (max **800** characters)  
* Destination URL (website URL the Pin links to)  
* Media URL (a **publicly accessible** link to the image or video file)  
* Board ID  
* Alt text  
* Simplified Pin flag  
* Scheduled time (**ISO 8601** timestamp)

A draft can be created as long as **at least one** supported field is provided for a row.

*Optional Helpers*

* Download an optional CSV template that includes all supported fields with headers Tailwind can map reliably.  
* Download a list of **board IDs and board titles** for the connected account (boards can share names, so IDs are required for unambiguous assignment).

**How to Access**

* CSV Import is available inside **Pin Scheduler**.  
* Hover over **Upload Pins** in the sub-nav.  
  * **Upload Media** – the existing upload flow  
  * **Import CSV** – the new CSV import flow  
* The Import CSV screen includes field support notes, formatting requirements, and the optional template/board ID downloads.

**Key Benefits**

* Preserve spreadsheet-first workflows without forcing users to change their system.  
* Import large volumes of Pins far faster than manual creation.  
* Repeatable, data-first draft creation for campaigns, backfills, and structured Pinterest systems.  
* Control advanced fields (alt text, simplified pins, scheduled time) at scale.  
* Seamless handoff into Pin Scheduler for review, validation, spacing, and scheduling.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Spreadsheet-Driven Pinterest Systems:** Import Pins from the workflow you already use.  
* **High-Volume Campaigns:** Create drafts for seasonal or evergreen batches in minutes.  
* **Backfills & Migrations:** Deterministically recreate a planned set of drafts from structured data.  
* **Power User Efficiency:** Reduce repetitive work and focus on optimization.

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* CSV Import creates **drafts only**; it does not publish Pins.  
* Drafts are not guaranteed to be publish-ready—validation happens inside **Pin Scheduler**.  
* Rows with partial data may still create drafts; users must resolve missing/invalid fields before scheduling.  
* Board assignment requires **Board IDs** (not board names).  
* Media URLs must be publicly accessible links to the actual file.  
* Scheduled times must be formatted in ISO 8601.

**Related Features**

* **Pin Scheduler** – where imported drafts are reviewed, edited, validated, and scheduled.  
* **Pin Spacing** – helps safely distribute imported drafts once scheduled.  
* **SmartSchedule** – optimizes timing once drafts are in the calendar.  
* **Ghostwriter** – refine or regenerate titles and descriptions after import.

### **Feature Documentation: Multi-Network Scheduler**

*Create, manage, and schedule posts across Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook from one streamlined flow.*

**Category:** Scheduling / Multi-Network  
**Also Known As:**  
*External / User-Facing:* Multi-Network Posts, Cross-Platform Scheduler  
*Internal Only (not surfaced to users):* Quick Schedule, 2.0 Scheduler, TWNext Scheduler


### **Feature Documentation: Multi-Network Scheduler**

*Create, manage, and schedule posts across Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook from one streamlined flow.*

**Category:** Scheduling / Multi-Network  
**Also Known As:**  
*External / User-Facing:* Multi-Network Posts, Cross-Platform Scheduler  
*Internal Only (not surfaced to users):* Quick Schedule, 2.0 Scheduler, TWNext Scheduler

**Problem It Solves**

* Managing content across multiple social platforms is fragmented and time-consuming.  
* Users want one place to upload, edit, and schedule content for Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook.  
* Switching between tools or re-creating similar posts for different networks creates inefficiency.  
* Each network has unique posting requirements (captions, hashtags, board selections, etc.), which adds complexity.  
* Consistency across platforms is hard to maintain without a centralized scheduler.  
* Risk of forgetting to post on one network while staying active on another undermines performance.  
* Agencies and businesses with multiple accounts struggle to maintain a unified, error-free workflow.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

* Upload media once and create drafts for multiple platforms (Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook).  
* Option to create carousel posts when multiple assets are uploaded.  
* Tailwind Create integration: design images before drafting posts.  
* AI support: Ghostwriter for captions and titles.  
* Hashtag Finder integration for Instagram Feed and Stories to surface recommended hashtags.  
* Manage drafts across networks in one hub with filtering and multi-select actions.  
* Schedule posts with network-specific fields and functionality.  
* Smart Schedule integration provides **recommended times** for Pinterest & Instagram (unlike Pin Scheduler, where Smart Schedule directly powers automatic time slots).  
* After scheduling, users are directed to their Dashboard, where they can see all scheduled posts (including those just published) on their unified Tailwind calendar.

*Advanced Controls*

* **Upload step (a.k.a. Frictionless Uploads internally):** choose media or Tailwind Create, pick post types (Pins, IG Feed, IG Stories, FB posts), set defaults, and authorize accounts if not connected.  
* **Drafts screen:** access from sidebar, filter by account or post type, bulk actions (delete, edit, schedule), start new posts via upload. Includes CTA to access **Made4U**, though Made4U is a related feature rather than core functionality of Multi-Network Scheduler itself.  
* **Scheduling experience:** vertical layout for one or multiple posts, collapsed/expanded editing views. Network-specific features:  
  * **Pinterest Pins:** Title, description, alt text, URL, board selection (incl. Board Lists), simplified pin toggle, Ghostwriter, video cover selection, Smart Schedule recommended times \+ custom time.  
  * **Instagram Feed:** Caption (Ghostwriter), Featured Hashtag Finder, saved hashtags, auto-post or SMS reminder, location & people tagging, grid preview, Smart Schedule recommended times \+ custom time.  
  * **Instagram Stories:** Caption (Ghostwriter), Featured Hashtag Finder, saved hashtags, SMS Reminder only, custom time only (no Smart Schedule).  
  * **Facebook Page posts:** Caption (manual or Ghostwriter), change media, custom time only (no Smart Schedule).

**How to Access**

* From dashboard: CTA near the top labeled **Multi-Network Posts**.  
* From left sidebar: **Drafts** tab for managing pending content.  
* Scheduling experience opens automatically after uploading or when editing drafts.  
* After completing scheduling, users return to the **Dashboard**, where the calendar displays all upcoming posts across networks.

**Key Benefits**

* Save time by uploading once and scheduling across platforms.  
* Maintain consistency of brand voice and posting cadence on Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook.  
* Simplify workflow with Ghostwriter, Tailwind Create, and Hashtag Finder integrations.  
* Leverage Smart Schedule recommendations for Pinterest and Instagram to improve timing.  
* Manage everything in one place—no more juggling tools or duplicating effort.  
* Easily filter, bulk edit, and schedule drafts across multiple accounts and networks.  
* Reduce errors by managing multiple accounts from one centralized hub.  
* Customize posts per network while still saving time with shared media.  
* Gain visibility into all scheduled posts via the unified Dashboard calendar.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **All-in-One Hub:** Manage Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook posts without switching tools.  
* **Upload Once, Post Everywhere:** Repurpose the same media into tailored posts across networks.  
* **AI-Powered Efficiency:** Use Ghostwriter for captions and descriptions while focusing on strategy.  
* **Smart Timing Built In:** Get Smart Schedule recommendations for Pinterest and Instagram posts.  
* **Visual Planning:** Preview Instagram grid before publishing for a cohesive look.  
* **Centralized Calendar View:** After scheduling, monitor everything in one calendar on the Dashboard.  
* **Multi-Account Management:** Perfect for agencies or businesses managing multiple Pinterest, Instagram, or Facebook accounts.

**Proof Points**

* \[Placeholder: Tailwind data/stat on time saved with Multi-Network Scheduler vs. managing networks separately\]  
* \[Placeholder: Customer quote on convenience and consistency across platforms\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* Pinterest media not visible inline during scheduling—must be changed via CTA.  
* Smart Schedule in Multi-Network Scheduler only powers **time recommendations**, not auto-slotted time slots like in Pin Scheduler.  
* Smart Schedule only applies to Pinterest and Instagram; Stories (custom only) and Facebook (custom only) lack suggested times.  
* Instagram Stories limited to SMS reminder posting (no auto-post).  
* Usage draws from AI credit allocation (Ghostwriter), limited by plan tier.  
* Multi-account setups require careful filtering to avoid posting to the wrong account.  
* Certain Instagram auto-post features only work with eligible account types (e.g., business accounts connected via API).

**Related Features**

* **Pin Scheduler** – specialized Pinterest scheduling tool with advanced controls.  
* **SmartSchedule** – provides optimized posting times for Pinterest & Instagram.  
* **Ghostwriter** – generates captions, titles, and descriptions for all supported networks.  
* **Made4U** – AI-generated post creation accessible from Drafts, though not core to Multi-Network Scheduler.  
* **Tailwind Create** – image design tool integrated into the upload flow.

*End writer’s block and save hours by instantly generating optimized titles, descriptions, captions, and marketing content across Tailwind.*

**Category:** Copilot / AI Creation  
**Also Known As:** AI Text Generator, Copy Assistant

**Problem It Solves**

* Writing compelling copy for every Pin, Instagram caption, Facebook post, blog, or product listing is repetitive and time-consuming.  
* Users struggle with writer’s block and uncertainty about what wording will perform best.

* Inconsistent tone or style across networks and formats weakens branding and reduces engagement.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

* Generate AI-written Pin titles and descriptions instantly inside Pin Scheduler.  
* Bulk Ghostwriter: create unique titles and descriptions for multiple Pins at once, outside Pin Scheduler.  
* Provide keyword-optimized copy aligned with Pinterest best practices.  
* Extend AI copywriting to Instagram captions and Facebook Page posts within Multi-Network Scheduler.

*Advanced Controls*

* **Dedicated Ghostwriter page** (left-hand sidebar) with a wide range of use cases:  
  * Pinterest title & description from a URL (blog/article)  
  * Image captions  
  * Open-ended text generation from a prompt  
  * Hashtags  
  * Blog Wizard: 3-step flow to generate topics, outline, and final draft (editable at each stage)

* Integrated seamlessly with SmartPin to generate full Pins (image \+ copy).  
* Bulk creation mode allows one-click generation of variations across a campaign.  
* In scheduling flows (Pin Scheduler, Multi-Network Scheduler), users must select a “Posting About” type to guide copy generation. Options include:  
  * **Featured Product** — highlights product details and benefits.  
  * **Sale or Promotion** — emphasizes discounts, urgency, and value.  
  * **Behind the Scenes** — gives a personal, authentic look into the brand.  
  * **Lifestyle Content** — connects products or services to everyday life moments.  
  * **Informational Content** — educates with tips, facts, or how-tos.  
* Users can optionally add keywords or phrases to include in the generated copy.  
* Users can also optionally specify a call-to-action (CTA) phrase (e.g., “Shop now\!”) to ensure it appears in the generated copy.  
* **Personalization:** Users can provide a website in Tailwind settings. Tailwind analyzes the site to infer business type, brand tone, and writing style. These personalization settings are stored, visible to the user, and can be edited manually. Users can toggle personalization on or off when generating Ghostwriter content, allowing outputs to better reflect their brand voice.

**How to Access**

* Full Ghostwriter tool available from the left-hand sidebar for expanded copy use cases.  
* Available directly inside the Pin Scheduler when editing or drafting a Pin.  
* “Generate with Ghostwriter” button appears next to title and description fields.  
* Also accessible in SmartPin workflow (auto-applies Ghostwriter text to new SmartPins).  
* Bulk Ghostwriter option available in a dedicated tool within the Pin Scheduler navigation.  
* Integrated into Multi-Network Scheduler when creating Instagram or Facebook posts.  
* Ghostwriter usage draws from monthly AI credits included in every plan (Free, Pro, Advanced, Max). Credits reset each month and determine how much Ghostwriter a user can access.

**Key Benefits**

* \[Placeholder: Customer testimonial on overcoming writer’s block or saving hours\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* AI suggestions should be reviewed for accuracy, tone, and brand alignment.  
* Ghostwriter’s output quality depends on the context provided (e.g., destination URL, campaign details, selected “Posting About” type).  
* Heavy use draws from the user’s monthly AI credit allowance. Credits are allocated by plan: Free, Pro, Advanced, and Max each include a set number of AI credits that reset monthly.  
* Generated text may need edits to ensure compliance with platform guidelines.  
* Some advanced Ghostwriter tools (e.g., Blog Wizard, product listings) may not be included on all plan tiers.

### Feature Documentation: Tailwind Create

*Design scroll-stopping visuals fast, then send them straight to scheduling.*

**Category:** Creation / Design  
**Also Known As:**  
*External:* Image Designer, Pin Designer, Template Designer  
*Internal Only:* CreateNext (current), CreateClassic (legacy version now retired)

**Problem It Solves**

* Designing fresh, on-brand images for every post is time-consuming and breaks the publishing flow.  
* Repurposing one idea across Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook requires repetitive resizing and layout tweaks.  
* Marketers struggle to keep visual quality high while moving quickly—leading to off-brand colors, inconsistent typography, or low-contrast text overlays.  
* Jumping between separate design tools and schedulers creates friction and version-control headaches.  
* Other design tools force users to start over for each new format, repeating inputs and wasting effort.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

* Create on-brand images using a library of templates purpose-built for social posts (Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook).  
* Upload or drag-and-drop images, search stock photos provided by Tailwind, or import images from a URL.  
* Apply brand styling (colors, fonts, logos) for consistent visuals across campaigns.  
* Preview designs across thousands of templates at once in the **Design Gallery**.  
* Enter inputs (title, subtitle, call to action, images, brand colors, logos) once and see them instantly applied across templates.  
* Export designs directly into Tailwind scheduling flows without file juggling.  
* Generate multiple design variations quickly to support fresh content needs.

*Advanced Controls*

* Choose from curated Tailwind color palettes or saved brand palettes.  
* Select branding mode: none, text (brand/website name), or logo (uploaded image placed in designated slots).  
* Resize/format for network-specific aspect ratios (e.g., 2:3 for Pinterest) within the same session.  
* Duplicate and batch-iterate designs to create series and seasonal variations.  
* Save brand presets (colors, fonts) to maintain visual consistency over time.  
* Integrates with Ghostwriter to pull in headlines, captions, or overlays without leaving the editor.  
* When inputs (photo or text) are set, templates populate in the Design Gallery for immediate preview.

**Design Gallery Actions**

* Switch between post types (Pinterest Pins, Instagram feed posts, Instagram Stories, Facebook feed posts).  
* Filter templates by number of photo slots (multi-photo, single-photo, no-photo) or by categories like industry, style, or seasonal trend.  
* **Favorite** templates for later reuse.  
* **Edit** (internal Quick Edit) for drag-and-drop flexibility.  
* **Shuffle** photos, layouts, and colors to explore variations instantly.  
* **Expand Post Types**: view all matching versions of a template across networks, shuffle in bulk, or select all for a coordinated set.

*Other Tabs in Tailwind Create*

* **Favorites Tab** – Displays all favorited templates. With project inputs present, templates are shown populated. Users can unfavorite here or from Design Gallery.  
* **Projects Tab** – Lists saved projects, each containing a set of inputs and saved state. Users can reopen to continue where they left off or start a new project.  
* **Brand Settings Tab** – Central hub for brand preferences:  
  * Website/brand name (text field).  
  * Fonts: choose title and subtitle fonts, or pick from curated pairings.  
  * Color palette: up to four colors, or select from curated palettes.  
  * Logos: upload image files (recommended minimum 200x200 pixels).

**Moving Designs Forward**

* Select designs in the gallery to open a right-side drawer with matching post types (e.g., if a Pin is selected, see Instagram, Facebook, and Story matches).  
* Continue selecting in the gallery or move forward to **Review Designs**.  
* **Review Designs Step**:  
  * Displays all selected designs with options to deselect, favorite, or edit further.  
  * Shows a breakdown of how many designs per post type.  
  * Provides a time-savings calculation based on Tailwind research comparing manual design vs Tailwind Create.  
  * Option to download selected designs or click **Go Schedule**.  
* **Go Schedule Flow**:  
  * Confirm which accounts to publish to (add new accounts or upgrade plan if limits reached).  
  * If only Pinterest Pins are selected → user is sent to **Pin Scheduler**.  
  * If designs include Instagram, Facebook, or a mix → user is sent to **Multi-Network Scheduler** (internally known as Quick Scheduler).  
  * Drafts are shared across schedulers, so one draft appears consistently in Pin Scheduler and Multi-Network Scheduler.

**How to Access**

* From **Multi-Network Scheduler** upload step: choose **Tailwind Create** to design before drafting posts.  
* From the **Drafts** workflow: start a new post and select **Tailwind Create** to build images first.  
* From **Pin Scheduler**: accessible during asset selection to design Pinterest-optimized visuals on the fly.

**Key Benefits**

* Produce professional, consistent visuals in minutes—not hours.  
* Eliminate tool-switching by moving from design → schedule in one flow.  
* Keep every image on-brand with reusable presets for colors, fonts, and logos.  
* Accelerate “fresh Pin” production by spinning up multiple variations fast.  
* Improve clarity and engagement with layouts tuned for social readability.

* Create matching designs for multiple networks at the same time, without repetitive rework.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Fresh Pins at Scale:** Turn one blog post into a week’s worth of unique, Pinterest-ready designs.

* **Promo-Ready Visuals:** Quickly produce sale/launch graphics that match your brand system.  
* **Evergreen Library:** Build a reusable set of templates for recurring series (tips, testimonials, product highlights).  
* **Faster Than Canva:** Skip repetitive inputs—Tailwind Create applies your brand elements across thousands of templates instantly.

**Proof Points**

* \[Placeholder: Insert Tailwind data/stat on time saved designing vs. external tools\]  
* \[Placeholder: Customer quote on faster workflow and brand consistency\]

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* Output quality depends on source imagery and brand inputs; poor photos limit results.  
* Advanced, pixel-perfect illustration or complex photo manipulation may still require pro design software.  
* Feature availability and export volume may be constrained by plan tier and monthly AI/automation credits where applicable.  
* CreateClassic allowed favoriting of custom designs, while CreateNext (current) only allows favoriting templates.

**Related Features**

* **Multi-Network Scheduler** – create once, schedule across Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook.  
* **Pin Scheduler** – send Pinterest-optimized designs directly into the queue.

### **Feature Documentation: Keyword Research**

*Find Pinterest keywords with the highest potential for reach—using Pinterest-native signals and a unified strength score.*

**Category:** Pinterest SEO  
**Also Known As:** Pinterest Keyword Tool, Pinterest SEO Research

**Problem It Solves**

* Pinterest creators and marketers struggle to know which keywords actually help Pins get seen.  
* Pinterest’s own keyword search volume data is limited—many valuable queries have **no official volume**, even when other Pinterest signals suggest they matter.  
* Pinterest SEO research often requires tedious manual work: checking type-ahead suggestions, scanning Trends, reviewing related Ideas/Interests, and exploring visual search suggestions.  
* Comparing keywords is difficult because each signal uses different formats and scales—making apples-to-apples evaluation hard.

**Solution in Tailwind**  
*Core Functions*

* Search by a **seed keyword** or by a **URL**.  
  * For URL searches, Tailwind analyzes the page and surfaces relevant keyword suggestions.  
* Results include a list of keywords with:  
  * **Pinterest search volume** (when Pinterest provides it)  
  * **Resonance Score** (strength score) visualized as five circles (0–10 scale with half steps)  
  * Actions to **save** keywords for reuse  
* Users can run additional searches and build a library of saved keywords.

*Signals Used (Called Out for Transparency)*

Keyword Research pulls from multiple Pinterest-native sources, including:

* Pinterest Ideas / Interests and related suggestions  
* Pinterest visual search suggestions  
* Pinterest type-ahead suggestions (including letter-by-letter expansion)  
* Pinterest Trends data  
* Audience size signals from Pinterest’s ads API  
* Pinterest designation of shopping intent (where available)  
* Pinterest-provided search volume (where available)

**How to Access**

* Keyword Research is available as a main left-nav item, badged as **Beta**.  
* On first load, users see a search field, instructions, and an explanation of the signals Tailwind uses.  
* After searching, users remain on the results view to review Resonance Score, volume (when available), and save keywords.  
* A **Saved Keywords** tab provides quick access to previously saved keywords with copy actions.

**Key Benefits**

* Access Pinterest reach signals without manual research.  
* Compare keywords apples-to-apples using a unified strength score.  
* Find strong keyword opportunities even when Pinterest search volume is missing.  
* Build a reusable keyword library for Pinterest content creation.  
* Quickly copy keywords into Tailwind workflows to improve relevance and reach.

**Use Cases / Angles**

* **Stop Manual Research:** Replace tedious type-ahead and Trends checks with one search.  
* **Confidence Without Guesswork:** Make keyword decisions based on Pinterest-native signals.  
* **Smarter Pin Creation:** Use saved keywords to improve titles and descriptions.  
* **Seasonal Opportunity Discovery:** Use Trends and related signals to spot rising demand.

### **Resonance Score Explained**

*Tailwind’s unified strength score for evaluating Pinterest keywords.*

Resonance Score exists to turn a messy landscape of Pinterest signals into a single, easy-to-use metric. The goal is to help users compare keywords fairly—even when some signals are missing or inconsistent across terms.

**How It Works**

Each keyword is evaluated using as many Pinterest-native signals as are available, including:

* Type-ahead expansions  
* Pinterest Trends movement  
* Interests and related ideas  
* Visual search suggestions  
* Audience size  
* Shopping intent  
* Search volume (when available)

Signals are normalized and combined into one output.

**What the Score Means**

* Primarily: Resonance Score is a **strength score**—a fast indicator of how promising a keyword is for Pinterest reach.  
* Secondarily: In detailed behavior, it also incorporates **relevance to the original seed keyword or URL**, helping users compare results on a consistent scale.

**Scale & Visualization**

* Displayed as **five circles** with half steps (0–10 scale).  
  * 9–10: extremely strong  
  * 7–8: high potential  
  * 4–6: moderate or situational  
  * 1–3: low strength

**Limitations / Gotchas**

* Pinterest search volume is only available for some terms.  
* Resonance Score is not an official Pinterest ranking; it is Tailwind’s proprietary combination of Pinterest signals plus relevance.  
* Audience size and shopping intent may not be available for every keyword.  
* Saved Keywords are currently designed for saving and copying; deeper integrations are planned.  
* While Keyword Research is in **beta**, all users have **unlimited keyword searches and unlimited saved keywords** regardless of plan. This may change after beta.

**Related Features**

* **Pin Scheduler** – paste keywords into Pin titles/descriptions for stronger relevance.  
* **Ghostwriter** – generate keyword-informed titles and descriptions quickly.  
* **SmartPin** – incorporate saved keywords into automated fresh Pin creation.
