# Ralph Progress - Milestone 8 (Per-Issue Slices)
# Legacy history is preserved in ralph/progress_legacy.txt

=== Slice Start: #103 Fix run scoping: use pipeline_run_id instead of timestamp heuristics ===
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Branch: ralph/m8-103-run-scoping
- Notes: Initialized per-issue slice for Milestone 8.

=== Iteration 1: Implementation Complete ===
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Changes:
  1. Created migration 010_conversation_run_scoping.sql
     - Adds pipeline_run_id column to conversations table
     - Creates index for efficient run-scoped queries
  2. Updated src/db/classification_storage.py
     - store_classification_result() now accepts pipeline_run_id parameter
     - store_classification_results_batch() now accepts pipeline_run_id parameter
     - Both functions store pipeline_run_id in conversations table
  3. Updated src/two_stage_pipeline.py
     - run_pipeline_async() now accepts and passes pipeline_run_id
     - run_pipeline() (sync version) now accepts and passes pipeline_run_id
     - _run_coda_pipeline_async() now accepts and passes pipeline_run_id
     - All store_classification_results_batch() calls pass pipeline_run_id
  4. Updated src/api/routers/pipeline.py
     - _run_pipeline_task() passes run_id to run_pipeline_async()
     - Fixed timestamp heuristic in _run_theme_extraction():
       OLD: JOIN pipeline_runs pr ON c.classified_at >= pr.started_at
       NEW: WHERE c.pipeline_run_id = %s
  5. Created tests/test_run_scoping.py
     - Tests for storage function signatures
     - Tests for pipeline function signatures
     - Tests for migration existence
     - Tests for theme extraction query fix
     - Integration tests (skipped - require DB)
- Test Results:
  - All 7 run scoping tests PASSED (2 skipped - require DB)
  - Full backend test suite: 782 passed, 11 skipped, 1 failed (unrelated latency test)
  - Pipeline API tests: 30 passed
- Commit: 6bf9c79
- Push: Complete (branch: ralph/m8-103-run-scoping)

=== Iteration 2: PR Created + 5-Personality Review ===
- Date: 2026-01-22
- PR URL: https://github.com/paulyokota/FeedForward/pull/112
- Review Round 1:
  - Reginald (Architect): BLOCK - 4 HIGH issues (NULL handling, ON CONFLICT, FK)
  - Sanjay (Security): BLOCK - 2 CRITICAL issues (FK CASCADE, authorization)
  - Quinn (Quality): BLOCK - 2 CRITICAL issues (NULL black hole, backfill)
  - Dmitri (Pragmatist): APPROVE - 1 MEDIUM (pre-existing duplication)
  - Maya (Maintainer): APPROVE - 1 HIGH (unclear ON CONFLICT semantics)
- Fixes Applied (commit 9ab0441):
  1. NULL handling: Added timestamp fallback for pre-migration conversations
  2. ON CONFLICT: Use COALESCE to keep first run (immutable)
  3. FK CASCADE: Added ON DELETE SET NULL
  4. Documentation: Added backfill strategy and semantics comments
- Review Round 2: All 5 reviewers APPROVE
- Status: CONVERGED in 2 rounds
- PR #112 MERGED (squash) to main

=== Slice Complete: #103 ===
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Final Commit: a5d3327 (squash merge)
- Summary: Fix run scoping with backward-compatible NULL fallback
- Next Slice: #89 Pipeline-critical tests for canonical flow

=== Slice Start: #89 Pipeline-critical tests for canonical flow ===
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Branch: (to be created)
- Notes: Next Phase 1 item per T-004 priority. Tests unblock #108, #109.
