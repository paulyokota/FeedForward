ISSUE: #62 fix(research): coda_page adapter fails with "no such column: name"
STATE:
- Identified root cause: coda_adapter.py SQL queries referenced `name` and `parent_id` columns that don't exist in SQLite schema.
- Actual schema: pages table has `canvas_id`, `title` (not `name`), `content`, `file_path`, `char_count`, `extracted_at` (no `parent_id`).
- Fixed _extract_page(), _extract_all_pages(), and _row_to_page_content() methods.

CHANGES:
- src/research/adapters/coda_adapter.py:
  - Changed `name` -> `title` in SELECT queries
  - Removed `parent_id` from SELECT queries
  - Removed `parent_id` from metadata dict in _row_to_page_content()

TEST RESULTS:
- All 18 coda-related tests pass.
- 3 pre-existing failures in unrelated tests (latency, theme extraction).
- No new failures introduced.

NEXT:
- Commit the fix.
- Create PR for #62.
- Wait for 5-personality review and CONVERGED comment.
