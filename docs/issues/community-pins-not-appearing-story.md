## Summary

**3 customer reports** | First seen: Dec 24, 2025 | Last seen: Jan 12, 2026

Pins scheduled with community assignment publish successfully to Pinterest but do not appear in the Communities "Yours" tab. Database records (`tribe_content_documents`) exist for the submissions, indicating the backend recorded the assignment correctly - the issue appears to be in the UI/retrieval layer.

## Symptoms

- Pins scheduled with community assignment
- Pins publish successfully to Pinterest ✓
- Pins do not appear in Communities 'Yours' tab ✗
- DB records (tribe_content_documents) exist for submissions
- Issue affects both Original Publisher and new Pin Scheduler
- Bug started around November 2025 based on earliest reports

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis

Synchronization issue between pin publishing and community visibility - backend records exist but UI doesn't reflect them. The data layer is correctly recording community assignments, but the display/retrieval layer is not surfacing them to users.

> "Hello, I would like to ask you to check my account and clarify why my pins published via you have not been appearing in my tribes/communities for two months (since around the beginning of November). I have assigned all of my English pins, including those planned for the future, to a community when creating them. The pins appear correctly on Pinterest, but not in the communities. This is a big problem and I would like to ask you to resolve it as soon as possible."

**Additional context:** Pinterest suspended her account for 36 hours during the timeframe when the issue started - Pinterest apologized and said it was a mistake on their part.

>
> [Follow-up]: "The pins are published but aren't in the yours tab"

**Additional context:** Uses Pin Scheduler. Confirmed same issue persists after trying troubleshooting steps.

> "My pins are not being posted in the communities. Even after they are published on Pinterest. The Pins I add to Communities are not showing up in the Communities even after they are published. I have checked the Yours tab. This has been happening for around two weeks, and I was hoping it would sort itself out eventually, but it is still the same."

**Additional context:**

- Provided screenshots proving pins were scheduled with community assignment
- Affected pins: Chocolate Muffins, Garlic Rolls, Oreo Truffles
- Workaround: Has to manually add each pin after it posts, which is "quite a hassle"
- Expressed frustration: "Tailwind is supposed to be about scheduling in advance and being hands-free. And for how expensive it is, these kinds of small but constant glitches really shouldn't be happening."

## Suggested Investigation

1. Review `tailwind_communities` code for issues matching symptoms
2. Check logs for errors in Pin Scheduler → Tailwind Communities → Yours Tab Display flow
3. Verify API responses and error handling in community content retrieval
4. Compare `tribe_content_documents` records with what's displayed in the UI
5. Check if there's a timing issue between when pins publish and when community visibility is updated

## Engineering Notes

From Slack thread (Mike/Taylor):

- Engineering team is actively investigating
- DB query confirms `tribe_content_documents` records exist for the submissions
- The data is being written correctly - issue is in retrieval/display
