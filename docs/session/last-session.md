# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-12 12:30
**Branch**: webapp-analytics-and-fixes

## Goal

Coda extraction strategy documentation and skills migration validation

## Progress

- Completed: 4 tasks
- Pending: 0 tasks

## What Was Done

1. **Skills Migration Validation** (PR #31 merged)
   - Verified v2 skills architecture was properly wired up
   - Converted old agent profiles to redirect stubs
   - Updated CLAUDE.md references

2. **Coda Extraction Strategy** (PR #32 created)
   - Created `docs/coda-extraction/coda-extraction-doc.md`
   - Created `docs/coda-extraction/coda-extraction-pmt.md`
   - Philosophy: "Extract Everything, Decide Later"
   - Coda as peer data source (equal weight to Intercom)

3. **Earlier: Coda Story Feature Parity**
   - Backend formatter functions for Coda excerpts
   - Frontend EvidenceBrowser with source-aware URLs
   - 5-personality review converged

## Key Decisions

- Coda themes equal weight to Intercom themes (peer sources)
- Hybrid extraction: Playwright (pages) + API (tables, hierarchy)
- Output to `data/coda_raw/` with manifest tracking
- One-time extraction, multiple downstream uses

## Session Notes

Session ended normally. PR #32 open for Coda extraction docs.
