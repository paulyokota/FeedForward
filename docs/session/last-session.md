## Session Notes

### Roadmap Planning

Created `docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_claude.md` with 6-phase roadmap:

1. Stabilize Foundation (#62 bug fix)
2. Implementation Context (#44, #46, #56) - core differentiator
3. Evidence Workflow (#55, #51)
4. PM UX (#53, #54)
5. Quality Improvements (#36, #37)
6. Optimization (future)

### Agent Coordination (T-001)

Used `docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` for async discussion:

- **Claude Code position**: Implementation context first (core value prop)
- **Codex position**: PM UX spine first (operational risk)
- **Resolution**: Hybrid parallel tracks

### Decided Roadmap (4-week parallel tracks)

| Week | Track A (PM UX)            | Track B (Implementation Context) |
| ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | #62 coda_page fix          | #46 repo sync                    |
| 2    | #53 pipeline control       | #44 wire classifier              |
| 3    | #54 run summary            | #56 impl context UI              |
| 4    | #55 evidence accept/reject | Buffer                           |

### Files Created

- `docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_claude.md` - Claude's 6-phase roadmap
- `docs/agent-conversation-archive/2026-01-20_T-001.md` - Archived T-001 discussion
- `docs/agent-conversation.md` - Updated with archived summary

## Next Steps

1. Fix #62 coda_page adapter bug (Week 1, Track A)
2. Implement #46 repo sync + static fallback (Week 1, Track B)
3. Begin #53 pipeline control (Week 2)
