# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-09 15:30
**Branch**: development

## Goal

Multi-source theme architecture planning - integrate Coda research data with Intercom support pipeline.

## Progress

- Completed: 4 tasks
- Pending: 0 tasks

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Explored Coda research repository** - Documented 100 pages, 100 tables with rich research data
2. **Developed core insight** - Research and support are complementary, not substitutes
3. **Created multi-source architecture plan** - 7-phase implementation spec
4. **Made design decisions** - Resolved conflicts between approaches (adapters vs sources, split vs consolidated imports)

## Design Decisions

| Decision            | Choice                   | Rationale                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Directory structure | `src/adapters/`          | Adapter pattern is precise         |
| Import scripts      | Split                    | Granular control, easier debugging |
| Analytics location  | `src/analytics/`         | Separation of concerns             |
| Story updates       | `src/story_formatter.py` | Formatting belongs with formatter  |

## Files Created/Modified

- `docs/multi-source/multi-source-architecture-ralph.md` - Detailed implementation spec
- `docs/multi-source/multi-source-phases-overview.md` - Quick reference
- `docs/coda-research-repo.md` - Repository analysis
- `docs/status.md` - Session notes added
- `docs/changelog.md` - Coda integration entry

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 0: Bulk Coda data import
2. Create `src/coda_client.py`
3. Build source adapters (`src/adapters/`)
4. Run database migration for `data_source` field

## Session Notes

Session ended normally. Multi-source architecture plan ready for implementation.
