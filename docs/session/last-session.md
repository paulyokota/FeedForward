# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Branch**: feature/story-tracking-webapp

## Goal

Fix FeedForward logo for both light and dark themes in Story Tracking Web App.

## Progress

- Completed: Logo trimming, transparency, dark mode version, theme-aware component
- Pending: None

## What Was Done

1. **Logo Trimming**: Trimmed logo from 1408x768 to 1397x262 (removed excess whitespace)
2. **Transparent Background**: Made logo background transparent using PIL
3. **Dark Mode Version**: Created feedforward-logo-dark.png with lightened "Feed" text
4. **Theme-Aware Component**: Updated FeedForwardLogo.tsx to switch logos based on theme
5. **Next.js Image Fix**: Switched from Next.js Image to native img tag to avoid optimization issues

## Files Changed

- `webapp/public/feedforward-logo.png` - Trimmed + transparent
- `webapp/public/feedforward-logo-dark.png` - Dark mode version (new)
- `webapp/src/components/FeedForwardLogo.tsx` - Theme-aware logo switching
- `webapp/src/app/globals.css` - Light theme fixes (neutral backgrounds)

## Session Notes

Logo now displays correctly in both light and dark modes. The "Feed" text was too dark to see on dark backgrounds, so a separate dark mode version was created with lightened text colors.
