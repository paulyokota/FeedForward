# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-26 (afternoon)
**Branch**: main

## Goal

Improve story content generation quality through manual testing and prompt refinement.

## Progress

### Completed

1. **Manual testing of content generation** on existing stories
   - Found that stories from signature-based grouping (deprecated) had incoherent data
   - Identified hybrid_cluster stories from Run 86 for proper testing

2. **AI Goal / Acceptance Criteria Coherence Fix** (commit 4ec9f9c)
   - Discovered AC could pass even when AI goal wasn't achieved
   - Added explicit coherence guidance to prompt
   - Rule: Agent achieving goal MUST also pass all acceptance criteria

3. **Symptom-Driven Title Verbs** (commit 91b60f8)
   - Removed rigid classification-to-action-verb mapping
   - `how_to_question` + missing feature symptoms now generates "Enable [feature]"
   - Previously forced "Clarify [topic] documentation" regardless of symptoms
   - Verified: bulk deletion story now correctly titled "Enable bulk deletion for scheduled pins"

### Key Decision

Let LLM choose title action verb based on symptoms, not category. Classification provides context but symptoms reveal the actual need.

## Session Notes

- Started by testing story 53b89828 (good hybrid data) and 4026a7e5 (garbage signature data)
- Reverted both stories after discovering they were from deprecated signature-based grouping
- Found and regenerated story 998bd347 (proper hybrid_cluster with 12 conversations)
- Voice mode used for real-time discussion of coherence and verb mapping issues

## Commits This Session

```
91b60f8 refactor: Let LLM choose title verb based on symptoms, not category
4ec9f9c fix: Add coherence guidance for AI goal and acceptance criteria
