# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Branch**: main

## Goal

Complete Pipeline Quality v1 milestone validation (Issue #129)

## Accomplished

### Pipeline Validation (Run 88)

- Executed 30-day pipeline run with all Phase 1 fixes active
- **Results**: 1,264 conversations → 507 themes → 21 stories + 341 orphans
- **Duration**: 1h 18m

### Quality Evaluation

| Area                   | Result                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Evidence Grouping      | PASS - No mixed root causes, PM review 95% split rate |
| Implementation Details | PASS - 21/21 stories have code_context                |
| Metadata Quality       | PASS - 19/21 good titles                              |
| Orphan Quality         | PASS - Rich theme_data                                |

### Phase 3 Decisions

All closed as not needed based on validation:

- **#123** (Clustering Semantics) - PM review handles edge cases adequately
- **#125** (Classification Persistence) - Orphan quality sufficient
- **#127** (Stable Cluster IDs) - No cross-run aggregation needed

### Issue Hygiene

- Closed 6 issues total: #95, #96, #97, #123, #125, #127, #129
- Fixed label inconsistencies on 6 issues
- Added P1 priority to pipeline-quality-v1 milestone issues

## Key Decisions

1. **Option B validated**: Simple clustering + PM review is sufficient; no need for hard constraints on product_area
2. **Milestone complete**: Pipeline Quality v1 achieved with Phase 1 fixes alone

## Session Notes

Pipeline produces good output. Remaining items (2 weak titles, code search precision) are tracked separately and not blockers for the milestone.
