## Session Notes

### Pipeline Run 98 Investigation

Diagnosed why run 98 failed with `[Errno 32] Broken pipe`:

| Finding    | Detail                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root cause | `print()` statements in classification pipeline crash when uvicorn reloads |
| Trigger    | File save during pipeline run triggered `--reload`                         |
| Impact     | Background task loses stdout → next print() raises BrokenPipeError         |

**Filed Issue #185** to track fixing print→logging conversion.

### Pipeline Run 99 (30-day)

Successfully ran full pipeline for 30 days:

| Metric                   | Count       |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Conversations classified | 1,543       |
| Themes extracted         | 600         |
| Stories created          | 43          |
| Orphans created          | 378         |
| Duration                 | ~53 minutes |

Component drift checker flagged some vocabulary consolidation opportunities (turbo_pin/turbo_pins, smart.bio/smartbio).

### Webapp Fix

Next.js dev server was stuck at 114% CPU for 43+ minutes. Killed and restarted - came back healthy in ~1 second.

## Decisions Made

1. Filed issue rather than immediately fixing broken pipe bug (non-blocking, workaround exists)
2. Used dev-pipeline-run.sh script as documented (handles pre-flight + cleanup)

## Blockers Encountered

- None
