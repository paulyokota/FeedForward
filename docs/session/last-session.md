# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-16 16:45
**Branch**: webapp-analytics-and-fixes

## Goal

VDD codebase search timing analysis and test run

## Progress

- Completed: VDD timing analysis, parallelization investigation, partial VDD run
- Pending: Complete full VDD iteration

## Key Findings

### VDD Timing (Per Conversation)

| Stage      | Time      | Notes                            |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Fetch      | <1 sec    | Database query                   |
| Search     | ~6 sec    | CodebaseContextProvider          |
| Evaluation | ~7-10 min | **Bottleneck** - dual Claude CLI |
| Learnings  | <1 min    | Diagnosis + code gen             |

### Parallelization Status

- Backed out in commit c97536a
- Cause: stdin-based CLI invocation doesn't support concurrent sessions
- Not worth investigating (low-confidence)

### Partial Run Results (Iteration 2)

| Conv | Precision | Recall | Notes                          |
| ---- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | 0.19      | 0.20   | Opus 59 files, Sonnet 27 files |
| 2    | 0.00      | 0.00   | Opus timed out (10m limit)     |
| 3    | -         | -      | Interrupted                    |

## Next Steps

1. Complete full VDD iteration
2. Investigate Opus timeout causes
3. Consider increasing timeout or using Sonnet-only mode

## Session Notes

Session ended by user request. VDD run gracefully terminated mid-evaluation.
