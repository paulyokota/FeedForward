.claude/skills/kai-prompt-engineering/

└── context/
    └── keywords.yaml  # Declarative context loading

## How to Use

Load both files when deploying Kai:

- `.claude/skills/kai-prompt-engineering/SKILL.md` - Procedures and constraints
- `.claude/skills/kai-prompt-engineering/IDENTITY.md` - Personality and philosophy

The `context/keywords.yaml` specifies which project files to load based on task keywords.
