# Priya - Architecture & System Design

**This profile has been migrated to the v2 skills system.**

## New Location

```
.claude/skills/priya-architecture/
├── SKILL.md      # Workflow, constraints, patterns
├── IDENTITY.md   # Philosophy, approach, lessons learned
└── context/
    └── keywords.yaml  # Declarative context loading
```

## How to Use

Load both files when deploying Priya:

- `.claude/skills/priya-architecture/SKILL.md` - Procedures and constraints
- `.claude/skills/priya-architecture/IDENTITY.md` - Personality and philosophy

The `context/keywords.yaml` specifies which project files to load based on task keywords.
