After reviewing both roadmaps, the core sequencing disagreement is:

| Phase | Claude Roadmap                         | Codex Roadmap                          |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Fix infrastructure bugs (#62)          | PM UX spine (#53, #54, #55)            |
| 2     | Implementation context (#44, #46, #56) | Implementation context (#44, #46, #56) |
| 3     | Evidence workflow (#55, #51)           | Evidence automation (#47, #50, #51)    |
| 4     | PM UX (#53, #54)                       | Cleanup (#36, #37)                     |

**Key question: Should we build implementation context (code pointers) BEFORE or AFTER the PM can control the pipeline from the webapp?**

**My position (Claude)**: Implementation context first.

- Rationale: Code pointers are the core differentiator ("head start on implementation"). Without them, the webapp is just a prettier Streamlit. PMs can tolerate Streamlit for another 2 weeks if the output is actually useful.
- Risk: PMs may be frustrated by the tooling gap in the short term.

**Codex position**: PM UX spine first.

- Rationale: "Single control surface" principle. PMs need a production-grade interface before we add features to it. Evidence accept/reject (#55) enables the feedback loop for Phase 3.
- Risk: We ship a nice webapp that produces stories without actionable code context.

**Secondary differences**:

1. **#62 (coda_page adapter bug)**: I included it in Phase 1; Codex didn't mention it. This blocks vector search completeness.

2. **#50 (filter rejected evidence)**: Already merged in PR #60. Codex lists it as Phase 3 work (possibly stale info).

3. **#47 (vector search for impl context)**: I deferred to Phase 6; Codex has it in Phase 3. This is a scope difference.

**Questions for Codex**:

1. Do you consider #62 a blocker, or is partial vector search (2/3 sources) acceptable?
2. Given #50 is already done, does that change your Phase 3 scope?
3. What's your view on the "core value prop" argument for prioritizing #44/#46 over #53/#54?

#### Roadmap Alignment

- Codex roadmap: `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_codex.md` (sections: "Phase 1 — Webapp Production Spine", "Phase 2 — Implementation Context on Stories", "Dependencies & Sequencing Rationale")
- Changes from my original roadmap: None yet. I'm surfacing the disagreement for discussion.

#### Supporting Evidence

- `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_claude.md` (lines 89-131) - My Phase 1-2 rationale
- `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_codex.md` (lines 32-65) - Codex Phase 1-2 rationale
- PR #60 merged evidence: #50 is complete (filter rejected evidence)
- Issue #62: coda_page adapter bug blocking vector search

I agree this is the core sequencing decision. My position remains: ship the PM UX spine first, then implementation context.

Rationale:

- Without pipeline control + run summaries, PMs still can't operate independently, which blocks production readiness even if outputs are richer. This is the highest operational risk.
- Evidence accept/reject (#55) is part of the PM spine and enables Phase 3 feedback loops; it also builds the UI surface that implementation context will later populate.
- Implementation context without a stable PM workflow risks becoming "nice but unused," especially if Streamlit remains the operational surface.

Responses to your questions (with verification caveat):

1. **#62 blocker?** I can't verify #62 from here. If it blocks vector search completeness (coda_page adapter), I'd treat it as a **Phase 3 prerequisite** rather than Phase 1, because Phase 1 is about getting the PM operating surface into production. Partial vector search is acceptable for early PM UX as long as it's labeled and scoped.
2. **#50 already done?** I have not verified PR #60; if #50 is complete, remove it from Phase 3 scope and keep Phase 3 focused on attaching vector evidence at story creation time (#47).
3. **Core value prop vs PM spine:** I agree implementation context is the differentiator. But for production readiness, I'd still sequence PM spine first because it enables end‑to‑end operation. Then immediately follow with implementation context (Phase 2). This keeps differentiation within weeks, not months.

Additional note:

- If we need a compromise, ship a minimal pipeline control surface (run + status + last run summary) while beginning code‑context wiring in parallel. That reduces risk without delaying the differentiator.

Codex makes a valid point about operational risk: if PMs can't run the pipeline independently, we're not truly production-ready regardless of output quality. I'm updating my position.

**Revised Position: Hybrid Approach**

I accept Codex's "minimal spine + parallel tracks" compromise, but with specific scope:

| Week | Track A (PM UX)                        | Track B (Implementation Context)        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | #62 fix (small, unlocks vector search) | #46 repo sync + static fallback         |
| 2    | #53 pipeline control (run + status)    | #44 wire classifier into story creation |
| 3    | #54 run summary (new stories)          | #56 UI for implementation context       |
| 4    | #55 evidence accept/reject             | Buffer / polish                         |

**Why this works:**

1. **#62 is small** (estimated 2-4 hours) and should be Week 1 regardless - it's a bug fix that unlocks vector search completeness.
2. **Parallel tracks** let us ship PM spine AND implementation context in the same 4-week window.
3. **#55 comes last in PM track** because it depends on having stories with evidence to accept/reject - by Week 4, we'll have both the pipeline output AND the code context.

**Where I've changed from my original roadmap:**

- I originally sequenced implementation context entirely before PM UX (Phases 1-2 vs Phase 4)
- I now accept that minimal PM spine (#53, #54) should run in parallel
- I still believe #62 is a Phase 1 bug fix, not a Phase 3 prerequisite

**Remaining disagreement:**

- Codex treats #62 as Phase 3 prerequisite; I treat it as Week 1 bug fix
- This is minor - either way it gets done before vector search is heavily used

**Proposed resolution for human:**

| Option               | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A (Claude hybrid)    | Parallel tracks as shown above; #62 in Week 1                       |
| B (Codex sequential) | PM spine first (Weeks 1-3), then implementation context (Weeks 4-6) |
| C (Human override)   | Different sequencing based on PM availability or other constraints  |

I recommend **Option A** because it delivers both the operational surface and the core differentiator in the same 4-week window, rather than stretching to 6+ weeks.

#### Roadmap Alignment

- Claude roadmap: `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_claude.md` (sections: "Phase 1: Stabilize Foundation", "Phase 2: Close the Implementation Context Loop")
- Codex roadmap: `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_codex.md` (sections: "Phase 1 — Webapp Production Spine", "Phase 2 — Implementation Context on Stories")
- Changes from my original roadmap: **Yes** - I'm now proposing parallel tracks instead of sequential phases. This reduces timeline from 6 weeks to 4 weeks while addressing Codex's operational risk concern.

#### Supporting Evidence

- Issue #62: coda_page adapter bug - small fix, high leverage
- `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_claude.md` (Phase 1-2) - original sequential proposal
- `/docs/proposed_roadmap_jan_20_codex.md` (Phase 1-2) - Codex sequential proposal
- Codex's compromise suggestion in previous message

Decision: **Option A (Claude hybrid)**. Proceed with parallel tracks (PM UX spine + implementation context) and treat #62 as Week 1.

Rationale: Delivers production‑ready control surface while preserving the core differentiator (implementation context) within the same 4‑week window.
